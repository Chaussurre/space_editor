- **Many custom components**: Space Editor implements various custom components to seamlessly integrate its saving system with the standard Bevy scene format. 
- **Easy API for customization**: Customize or register your own components within the editor with ease, tailoring it to your specific project needs.
- **API for adding tabs**: Extend the functionality of the editor by easily adding new tabs, enhancing your workflow. 

Getting Started
To run the editor, use the following command:
> cargo run

To run platformer example, use the following command:
> cargo run run --example platformer --features bevy_xpbd_3d


## Usage
### Prefab spawn system
To utilize the prefab spawn system, simply add the plugin to your application as follows:
```
App::default()
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .add_plugins(PrefabPlugin)
```

For spawning, use the PrefabBundle:
```
 commands.spawn(PrefabBundle::new("tile.scn.ron"))
        .insert(Name::new("Prefab"));
```

(More code at bin/spawn_prefab.rs)


### Editor integration
The editor is built for easy implementation into your game by adding a plugin to your app. Here's a minimal example of how to do this:

```
fn main() {
    App::default()
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
        .add_plugins(SpaceEditorPlugin::default())
        .add_systems(Startup, simple_editor_setup)
        .run();
}
```

(Code from main.rs)

## Customization

**More detailed information in docs/README.md**

Custom types can be added to the editor gui and prefab spawn system with just a single line:

```
app.editor_registry::<Name>();
```
The representation of components in the editor UI can also be customized by bevy_inspector_egui library.

### Prefab
A prefab is simply a Bevy scene serialized to a readable and editable RON format. However, it needs to be spawned through PrefabBundle to activate custom logic such as adding global transforms to an object.
